##Task 8 :Identify and Remove Suspicious Browser Extensions
##Objective: Understand the role of VPNs in protecting privacy and secure communication.
##Tools:Free VPN client (ProtonVPN free tier, Windscribe free)
##Deliverables: Report describing VPN setup steps and connection status screenshot.

Hints/Mini Guide:
1.Choose a reputable free VPN service and sign up.
2.Download and install the VPN client.
3.Connect to a VPN server (choose closest or any location).
4.Verify your IP address has changed (use whatismyipaddress.com).
5.Browse a website to confirm traffic is encrypted.
6.Disconnect VPN and compare browsing speed and IP.
7.Research VPN encryption and privacy features.
8.Write a summary on VPN benefits and limitations.

##Outcome: Hands-on experience with VPNs and understanding of privacy tools.

##VPN: Virtual Private Network
A VPN (Virtual Private Network) is a technology that creates a secure, encrypted connection between your device (like a phone or laptop) and the internet.

##PROTON VPN

    SIGN IN TO PROTON VPN
    GET STARTED
    CONNECT 
    WHEN I CHANGED MY SERVER, IT SHOWS MY VPN IP, NOT MY SYSTEM IP ON WHATISMYIPADDRESS.COM 
 

    A WEBSITE IS BROWSED, AND CONFIRMS THAT TRAFFIC IS ENCRYPTED 
    This shows that your internet traffic is now encrypted and flowing through the VPN.
    Look at the address bar:
      •	You should see a padlock icon to the left of the web address.
      •	This confirms the site uses HTTPS, meaning data between you and the site is encrypted.
 

    CONFIRM VPN ENCRYPTION IN ACTION on https://ipleak.net
      If the IP shown is different from your real IP and matches the VPN server location, you're secure.
      Hence, my system is now secure.
  


    REMOVING SUSPICIOUS BROWSER EXTENSIONS
    Look for:
      •	Unknown or untrusted extensions
      •	Anything you don’t remember installing
      Click Remove next to each one.

 
##RESEARCH
    Proton was born in Switzerland in 2014 when a team of scientists who met at CERN (the European Organization for Nuclear Research) decided to build a better internet where privacy is the default.
 
###Encryption used: Proton VPN uses AES-256 and ChaCha20 encryption
###Protocols used: OpenVPN and WireGuard.
 
###SWITCH TO PROTON VPN PRIVACY:


    It has features like:
			    mask your IP
			    swiss privacy 
			    No-logs policy
          NetShield Ad-blocker
          DNS leak protection
          Tor over VPN
          kill switch
          split tunneling
		
 
#VPN BENEFITS AND LIMITATIONS:

##Benefits of VPN

      1. Encrypts Internet Traffic
        •	VPNs encrypt your data (usually with AES-256) so third parties — like ISPs, hackers, or government agencies — can't see what you're doing online.
        •	Especially helpful when using public Wi-Fi (airports, cafes, hotels).
      2. Hides Your IP Address and Location
        •	VPN replaces your IP with the IP of the VPN server.
        •	Helps in masking your geographical location and identity.
      3. Bypasses Geo-Restrictions and Censorship
        •	Allows access to content blocked in your country (e.g., Netflix US from India, or WhatsApp in the UAE).
          •	Helps users in restrictive regions access free internet.
      4. Protects Against Tracking
        •	Prevents websites, apps, and advertisers from tracking your real IP.
        •	Makes ad tracking and fingerprinting harder.
      5. Safe File Sharing and Remote Work
        •	Enables secure connection to your company’s internal systems.
        •	Ideal for businesses and remote workers handling sensitive information.
      6. Prevents Bandwidth Throttling
        •	Some ISPs slow down speeds for streaming or gaming — VPNs hide your activity, reducing throttling.
      7. Avoids DNS and IP Leaks
        •	Good VPNs use private DNS servers and leak protection to ensure your traffic doesn’t escape the VPN tunnel.
      8. Can Help Save Money
        •	Prices for flights, hotels, or digital products can vary by region — using VPN servers from cheaper regions may offer better deals.
      9. Multi-Device Protection
          •	Most VPN services support multiple devices: PCs, phones, tablets, routers, etc.

##Limitations of VPN

      1. Slower Internet Speeds
        •	Due to encryption and rerouting of traffic, your browsing or download speed can drop, especially on free VPNs or distant servers.
      2. No Absolute Anonymity
        •	VPNs don’t make you anonymous — they only mask your IP.
        •	Your VPN provider can see your activity if they keep logs (use no-log services like ProtonVPN or Mullvad).
      3. Doesn’t Protect Against Malware or Phishing
        •	VPNs don’t block viruses, trojans, or malicious websites.
        •	You still need an antivirus and a secure browser.
      4. Some Services Block VPNs
        •	Streaming services, banks, and some websites detect and block VPN traffic.
        •	You may get CAPTCHA errors or be denied access.
      5. Legal or Policy Issues
        •	In some countries (e.g., China, Iran, UAE), VPN use is restricted or illegal.
        •	Always check local laws before using one.
      6. Free VPNs Can Be Risky
        •	Many free VPNs sell your data, inject ads, or provide weak encryption.
        •	Choose reputable free VPNs like ProtonVPN Free, Windscribe, or TunnelBear.
      7. Device Compatibility and App Limits
        •	Some older routers, smart TVs, or IoT devices don’t support VPNs without manual configuration.
      8. No Protection If VPN Drops
        •	If the VPN disconnects suddenly, traffic could leak unless a kill switch is enabled.
